/**
 * Constrains keyboard focus to a container while active, then restores focus when it
 * deactivates — the focus-management primitive behind modals, dialogs, and full-screen
 * overlays. See [docs/focus-patterns.md](../../docs/focus-patterns.md) for when a trap
 * is appropriate and the broader focus UX contract.
 *
 * Behavior, in detail:
 *
 * - **Activation.** When `isActive` becomes `true` and `containerRef` is populated, the
 *   hook records the currently focused element (for later restoration) and, on the next
 *   animation frame, moves focus to `initialFocusRef` if provided, otherwise to the first
 *   focusable element in the container. The `requestAnimationFrame` defer lets the overlay
 *   finish painting (and any entrance transition begin) before focus is set, which avoids
 *   focusing an element that is not yet laid out.
 * - **Fresh querying.** The set of focusable elements is recomputed on *every* `Tab`
 *   keypress rather than cached at activation. This keeps the trap correct when the
 *   container's contents change while open — newly mounted controls, conditionally
 *   rendered buttons, or fields toggling `disabled` are all picked up automatically.
 * - **Wrapping.** `Tab` on the last focusable element wraps to the first; `Shift+Tab` on
 *   the first (or when focus has somehow escaped the container) wraps to the last.
 * - **Escape.** `Escape` calls `preventDefault()` and invokes `onEscape`; it does not
 *   itself close anything.
 * - **Deactivation / restore.** On cleanup (when `isActive` flips to `false`, the
 *   container ref changes, or the component unmounts) the `keydown` listener is removed.
 *   If `returnFocusOnDeactivate` is `true`, focus is restored — on the next animation
 *   frame — to `returnFocusRef` if provided, otherwise to the element focused before
 *   activation. The rAF defer ensures the return target is focusable again (e.g. after
 *   the overlay has been removed from the DOM).
 *
 * Edge cases: a container with no focusable elements simply traps nothing (Tab is left
 * to the browser); a return target that has been removed from the DOM is skipped because
 * its `focus` is guarded.
 *
 * SSR-safety: the hook performs all DOM work inside `useEffect`, which never runs during
 * server rendering, so it is safe to call in SSR/SSG environments. Cleanup is automatic —
 * the `keydown` listener is always removed on deactivate/unmount.
 *
 * @param options - {@link UseFocusTrapOptions} controlling the container, activation, and
 *   initial/return focus behavior.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * function ConfirmDialog({ open, onClose }: { open: boolean; onClose: () => void }) {
 *   const dialogRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
 *   const confirmRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null)
 *
 *   useFocusTrap({
 *     containerRef: dialogRef,
 *     isActive: open,
 *     initialFocusRef: confirmRef, // focus the primary action on open
 *     onEscape: onClose,           // Escape requests a close
 *   })
 *
 *   if (!open) return null
 *   return (
 *     <div ref={dialogRef} role="dialog" aria-modal="true">
 *       <button onClick={onClose}>Cancel</button>
 *       <button ref={confirmRef} onClick={onClose}>Confirm</button>
 *     </div>
 *   )
 * }
